aprs-bigdata
============

bigdata experiments with data collected from APRS-IS

Several of us taking Bill Howe's Intro to Data Science on coursera are trying out some
big data analysis of APRS-IS data. Code for that project lives here.

See [the wiki](https://github.com/n2ygk/aprs-bigdata/wiki) for more information.
